Pattern Recognition Strategy is a prediction strategy we established observing what happened on financial markets.
Through our experience in trading, we had the opportunity to learn technical analysis and market fundamentals.

In fact, markets are efficient by definition, and since traders try to follow the technical analysis it results in the predicability of the market and we are able to observe patterns.

However, since patterns might be difficult to identify we tried to analyze and categorize each and every pattern using a mathematical approach.

We developed an algorithm which calculates the sum of relative distances between two points.
The output is a score, and the lower the score is the better the pattern matches to the reference curve.
